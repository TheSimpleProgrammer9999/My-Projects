<h1>Python tutorial</h1>
<p>Hi guys! So today I'll be talking about the basics of Python! If you don't know, Python is the most popular programming language. It is easy to learn, but versatile. You can make games, AI, face recognition, and much more!
    but now let's get right into Python coding!
</p>

<p>step 1: installing Python. You always need to install Python first before writing some code, you could use the online Python alternatives, but
    they're not effecient to use. so it's recommend to install the real Python. but using an IDE can also be ok. Like, VScode. but anyways, to install Python,
    well, I'm lazy to tell, so watch some YouTube tutorials then.
</p>

<p>step 2: boost up the Python program. After installing, just click on the Python logo, then you should see something like this:</p>

<p>step 3: basics of Python. The most basic code in Python is printing. In order to print something, you need to write it like this: print("put whatever you want here!")
        What you're printing should be in the double quotes. or else you'll get an error. for example, like this:
</p>

<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-15 131502.png" alt="printing screenshot">

<p>that's what it should looks like when you're printing. in this case, I will print the word "hello". as you can notice, it's in the double quotes.
     you'll get an error if you try to print a word or a sentence without the double quotes. like this:
</p>

<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-15 132136.png" alt="error screenshot">

<p>that's the error you'll get when you try to print a word without the double quotes. Python thinks it's a variable and give you an error because that variable doesn't exist. you'll have to assign it's value before printing it, or do anything with it. To learn more about variables, go to the next line.</p>

<p>ok. now that you've learned about printing, now I'll be explaining variables! If you don't know, variables are like a placeholder for a value.
    so here's how to make a variable in Python. it is surprisingly easy to make a variable in Python. just make your variable name, then put an equal sign,
    then after that, just write down what your value would be. For example, like this: var1=9  So in this case, I make a variable called var1. and I assign the value equal to 9.
    if your value is a text, then use double quotes. in programming languages, text are called a string. but if your value is a number, then just write the number down.
    in programming languages, numbers are called integers. for example, like this:
</p>

<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-15 133107.png" alt="variables">

<p>that's probably how you would make a variable, which have a string value. besides from printing with variables, you can also do math with variables. but this will only work for integers. if you try to do like this:</p>

<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-15 133531.png" alt="variable joining">

<p>it'll just join the two variables togheter. in this case, my first variable is assigned to "hello" and my second variable is assigned to "guys". if I try to add the variables like this: print(var1+var2) then the result will be like this: helloguys</p>
<p>so if you try to add a variable to a variable that are both strings, it'll just join them togheter. however, with integers, it is different. For example, like this:</p>

<img src="Screenshot 2024-04-15 134359.png" alt="sum of vars">

<p>guess what will be the answer? yep. the sum of the two added numbers. so it means if my first variable is assigned to 23 and the second one 45, if I add them togheter, it'll be 68. Just the sum of the two added numbers.</p>

<p>well, that's all I can talk about today. and even though I haven't actually talk about more things you could do in Python, I changed my mind, and will just talk about the basics of printing and variables. If you want to learn more, click this link:</p>
